# The error rate is defined as the ratio of virtual users that didn't complete their scenarios successfully to the total number of virtual users created during the test.
# To make Artillery exit with a non-zero if the total error rate exceeded 1%

# Scenarios launched
# is the number of virtual users created in the preceding 10 seconds (or in total)

# Scenarios completed
# is the number of virtual users that completed their scenarios in the preceding 10 seconds (or in the whole test).

# Requests completed
# is the number of HTTP requests and responses or WebSocket messages sent

# RPS sent is
# the average number of requests per second completed in the preceding 10 seconds (or throughout the test)

# Request latency is in milliseconds, and p95 and p99 values are the 95th and 99th percentile values.
# Codes provides the breakdown of HTTP response codes received.
